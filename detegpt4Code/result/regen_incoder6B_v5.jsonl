Now that I look at it again, I'm wondering if it's because your `num` variable isn't an array, or because your `for` loop is iterating over the `num` variable rather than the `num` list. I'll update my answer to reflect this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh, I see the problem. The `num` variable isn't an array, but you're iterating over it with `for num in nums`. My solution will work if you change your `nums` variable to be an array. I'll update my answer when I get back to my computer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI updated my answer, and added an alternative solution to my original answer.

It seems that you are not checking if the key already exists while adding it to the order. Thats why you get an error. Also you dont get the value from the cache. ```self.cache[key] = value``` needs to be added before ```self.order.append(key)```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, you are right.

Furthermore I assume that your input consists of solutions in the form of tuples (row, col, value).\n<code>\nstones = [[1,2,4], [1,3,4], [2,3,4], [1,2,5], [1,3,5], [2,3,5], [1,2,6], [1,3,6], [2,3,6], [1,2,7], [1,3,7], [2,3,7]]\n\ndef canCross(stones):\n    \n    if stone", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef canCross(stones):\n    \n    if stones[0] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    stone_set = set(stones)\n    \n    dp = {0: {0}}\n\n    for stone in stones:\n        if stone not in dp:\n            continue\n        for jump in  stones:\n            if jump == stone:\n                continue\n            if jump > stone:\n                continue\n            if jump in stone_set:\n                dp[stone][jump] = dp[stone][jump] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[stone][jump] = dp[stone][jump]\n    return False\n\ndef canCross_2(stones):\n    \n    if stones[0] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    stone_set = set(stones)\n    \n    dp = {0: {}, 1: {}, 2: {}, 3: {}, 4: {}, 5: {}, 6: {}, 7: {}, 8: {}, 9: {}}\n\n    for stone in stones:\n        if stone not in dp:\n            continue\n        for jump in  stones:\n            if jump == stone:\n                continue\n            if jump > stone:\n                continue\n            if jump in stone_set:\n                dp[stone][jump] = dp[stone][jump] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[stone][jump] = dp[stone][jump]\n    return False\n\ndef canCross_3(stones):\n    \n    if stones[0] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    stone_set = set(stones)\n    \n    dp = {0: {}, 1: {}, 2: {}, 3: {}, 4: {}, 5: {}, 6: {}, 7: {}, 8: {}, 9: {}}\n\n    for stone in stones:\n        if stone not in dp:\n            continue\n        for jump in  stones:\n            if jump == stone:\n                continue\n            if jump > stone:\n                continue\n            if jump in stone_set:\n                dp[stone][jump] = ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef canCross(stones):\n    \n    if stones[0] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    stone_set = set(stones)\n    \n    dp = {0: {0}}\n\n    for stone in stones:\n        if stone not in dp:\n            continue\n        for jump in  stones[stone]:\n            temp_dp = dp[stone]\n            for dx,dy in jump:\n                if dx not in temp_dp:\n                    temp_dp[dx] = {}\n                if dy not in temp_dp[dx]:\n                    temp_dp[dx][dy] = {}\n                temp_dp = temp_dp[dx][dy]\n            temp_dp[jump[-1]] = stone_set\n\n        if stone not in dp:\n            return False\n\n        dp = dp[stone]\n\n    return True\n```\n\"\"\"\n\ndef canCross(stones):\n    \n    if stones[0] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    stone_set = set(stones)\n    \n    dp = {0: {0}}\n\n    for stone in stones:\n        if stone not in dp:\n            continue\n        for jump in  stones[stone]:\n            temp_dp = dp[stone]\n            for dx,dy in jump:\n                if dx not in temp_dp:\n                    temp_dp[dx] = {}\n                if dy not in temp_dp[dx]:\n                    temp_dp[dx][dy] = {}\n                temp_dp = temp_dp[dx][dy]\n            temp_dp[jump[-1]] = stone_set\n\n        if stone not in dp:\n            return False\n\n        dp = dp[stone]\n\n    return True\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')\n\n    stones = map(int, input().split())\n\n    result = canCross(stones)\n\n    fptr.write(str(result) + '\\n')\n\n    fptr.close()\n\n<|/ file source=github |>\n<| "}

It says \n<code>\nclass Brick:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, w, h):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n</code>\nNotice that the __init__ function takes in 4 arguments. Your code is calling it with only 3 arguments: x, y, and w. Your code should look more like:\n<code>\nclass Brick:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, w, h):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n</code>\nYou can fix this by adding another argument to __init__. Let's say the wall has x walls, y bricks, and w brick widths.\n<code>\nclass Brick:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, w, h, wall):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n        self.wall = wall\n</code>\nNow you can do wall.Bricks() and it should work fine.\n<|/ a dscore=0 tags=python,python-3.x,class |>\n<| c |>\nSorry but I'm still getting the same error.

You are missing the body of the function, which is what goes between the parentheses:\n<code>\ndef canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine):\n    for char in ransomNote:\n        if char not in magazine:\n            return False\n    return True\n</code>\nWithout seeing your input data, I can't say for certain what the actual logic should be, but I suspect you want to return True whenever any of the characters in the ransomNote string are not in magazine, right?\nWithout knowing what your input data looks like, it's hard to say, but you might consider using the any() function instead:\n<code>\ndef canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine):\n    return any(char in magazine for char in ransomNote)\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=python,string,dictionary dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nthank you so much for answering my question.

In Python when you do dp[amount] you're actually doing a binary search. Python doesn't do integer division which means that your DP will not work for all inputs.\nTry doing this instead:\n<code>\ndp = [float('inf')] * amount\ndp[0] = 0\nfor coin in coins:\n    dp[coin] = min(dp[coin - coin], dp[coin])\n</code>\nIn Python you can also use functools.lru_", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def coinChange(coins, amount):\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    for coim in coins:\n        for i in range(1, amount + 1):\n            if coim > i:\n                dp[i] = min(dp[i - coim], dp[i])\n\n    return dp[amount]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease add the code to the question (use the edit button) and also the test code (don't post it in the comments)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nStill the code does not seem to work.

Can you share the code?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nAs we already discussed in comments, this is happening because of the fact that in countPrimes() the program is not changing the value of is_prime array. \nSo, in your code, you defined is_prime as an array of booleans. When you initialize is_prime with values False and True (as you did), it means that is_prime is actually an array of True and False values. The problem arises when you try to change these values. You are not changing the values of the array, but you are changing the values of is_prime itself. \nSo, when you pass is_prime to is_prime[j], you are actually not changing the values of is_prime but you are changing what is_prime points to. \nTo fix this, ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef countPrimes(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return 0\n        \n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    \n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, n, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    return sum(is_prime)\n    \n    ```\n\"\"\"\n</cell>\n<text>\nExcercise 2: Implement a function that prints all the prime numbers less than a specified number.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n\"\"\"\n    Excercise 2: Implement a function that prints all the prime numbers less than a specified number.\n    \n    \n    INPUT \n    n: an integer, the number whose prime numbers are to be printed.\n    \n    OUTPUT\n    Print the prime numbers less than n on a new line. \n    \n    Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef printPrimes(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return\n        \n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    \n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, n, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    for index in range(0, n):\n        if is_prime[index]:\n            print(index, end=\" \")\n    print()\n    \n    \n    ```\n\"\"\"\n</cell>\n<text>\nExcercise 3: Implement a function that counts all the prime numbers less than or equal to a specified number.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n\"\"\"\n    Excercise 3: Implement a function that counts all the prime numbers less than or equal ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef countPrimes(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return 0\n        \n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(2 * i, n, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    return sum(is_prime)\n\nfor n in range(1, 21):\n    print(countPrimes(n))\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nJust to complement the other answers, here is the code with the test function added, and the function countPrimes updated to use yield instead of return.\n<code>\ndef countPrimes(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        yield 0\n\n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(2 * i, n, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    yield sum(is_prime)\n\nfor n in range(1, 21):\n    print(countPrimes(n))\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 tags=primes,python,prime-factoring |>\n<| a tags=primes,python,prime-factoring |>\nYour code is not working because you have a couple of mistakes\n\nYou are returning the result before you even check for a prime number\nYou are returning the result before you check for any primes\n\nHere is how I would implement it using generators:\n<code>\ndef primes(n):\n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(2 * i, n, i):\n                is_prime"}

Thank you for your help\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI think the problem is that your problem statement says \"find the number of errors\" and you're returning \"the number of errors\". \nIt looks like you're trying to find the number of errors in the given array. \nWhen you call findErrorNums([1, 2, 3, 4], 1) it will return 1 as the number of errors is 1. \nWhen you call findErrorNums([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) it will return 0 as the number of errors is 0 since there are no errors. \nI think you need to return dp[n] instead of len(nums). \n<code>\ndef findErrorNums(nums, n):\n    n = ls = len(nums)\n    if n == 0:\n        return [0]\n    dp = [None] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    dp[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 2], nums[i - 1]) + 1\n    return dp[n]\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 tags=python,recursion,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nThis would return 0 as the number of errors is 0 since there are no errors.

Thank you!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nCan you explain what is the purpose of `dp` here? I'm wondering if it's related to DP but I can't figure it out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `dp` function does exactly what it says on the tin. DP basically is a dynamic programming algorithm for solving a problem where you have a sequence of values and want to find the shortest way from one value to the next that does not require you to visit all of the previous values. Since you are looking for the shortest path, DP solves the problem for you. It is a greedy algorithm but with a memoization, so it doesn't have to keep recalculating the same answer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=4 |>\nThis solution uses no recursion and a combination of iteration and list slicing, as well as numpy to do the heavy lifting. Basically, it finds the longest consecutive sequence starting with a specific value that doesn't contain the value itself, and returns a tuple of the start and end indexes of that sequence.\n<code>\ndef longest_consecutive_value(values, value):\n    indices = [i for i, v in enumerate(values) if v != value]\n    if indices:\n        prev = indices[0]\n        "}

Thank you for commenting. At the beginning of each recursion the `k` was set to `len(nums) - i` . At each recursion level `k` is decreased by `1` . `k` starts at `len(nums)-1` , `len(nums)-1` decreases by `1` . `len(nums)-1` decreases by `0` . `len(nums)-1` decreases by `-1` . `len(nums)", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef maxScore(nums, k):\n    n = len(nums)\n    dp = [nums[0]] * (n + 1)\n    dp[1] = max(nums)\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1], dp[i - 1])\n    return dp[n]\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nCan you please show me the code for solving this problem by your code?

I couldn't solve it by myself.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThis problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. The idea behind DP is to create an array of the same size as input array. The value of the array will represent the maximum sum upto that index. We can use the values from the array at that index and add it to the current maximum. \n<code>\ndef maxScore(nums, k):\n    n = len(nums)\n    ans = 0\n    dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0]=max(nums)\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        dp[i]=max(dp[i-1]+nums[i-1],dp[i-1])\n        ans=max(ans,dp[i])\n    return ans\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=4 tags=algorithm,python,max,dynamic-programming |>\n<| c |>\nCan you please explain how this algorithm is working.

Your `nums` parameter was a list of integers instead of an array.  I changed that to `nums = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes it works now! Thank you so much for the help. I appreciate it. And yes it did work with that change. I do have a question though, what is the difference between `nums = [int(num) for num in raw_input().strip().split(' ')] ` and `nums = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))`?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThey are basically the same thing. The difference is that in the first case, you have to type the list by hand, while in the second case, the input is already ready to go, and `map` takes a function and applies it to every item in a list.  For a quick explanation, see [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/949335/1030675).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYeah that makes sense. I guess my question was more about what is the difference between `nums = [int(num) for num in raw_input().strip().split(' ')]` and `nums = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))`."}

The idea behind my code is that `merge_sort` will return a `count` which is the number of pairs swap operations. To find the number of swap operations, we first reverse the array and then merge sort it. Then we count the swap operations using that `count` value.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh I see. Thanks for the clarification\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWow! This is an amazing answer! I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to implement a recursive solution.

If you are using recursion to solve the problem then the base case should be when you have no choice but to return the same number. Otherwise, the maximum value you can return is less than the length of the list.\nSecond, if you are not allowed to use any built-in function, then the maximum value you can return is 1 more than the length of the list.

Thanks again. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,python-3.x,algorithm dscore=1 |>\nSince this question already has an accepted answer, here's an answer with some explanations on why it works.\n\nFor each target, you count the number of ways to reach it by moving the target either up, down, left or right. For example, for target 1, the total number of ways to reach it is 2 + 2 + 1 since you can move the target either up, down, left or right once and that is the only way. For target 2, the total number of ways to reach it is 1 + 1 + 1 since you can move the target either up, down, left or right two times.\nThe total number of ways to reach a target is the sum of the number of ways to reach each of the adjacent targets. For example, for target 1, the total number of ways to reach it is 2 + 2 + 1 which is 6. Similarly, for target 2, the total number of ways to reach it is 1 + 1 + 1 which is 3.\nThe total number of ways to reach a target is equal to the number of ways to reach each of the adjacent targets + 1.\n\nThis means you can ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef reachTarget(target):\n    target = abs(target)\n    moves, total = 0, 0\n    while  total < target:\n        total += moves\n        moves += 1\n    return total - target + moves\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nCan you please explain what exactly you are trying to do, especially your `reachTarget` function?

I am a very beginner in programming. Basically the idea is to start from the point where the target is located and the end is at the last node in the tree. There must be a way to move in the direction of the tree. So lets say we want to find the number of moves one has to take to reach the point where the target is located - this would be the reachTarget function.

You have a variable called n that you are using to store the length of the list you are iterating over.

In the code below, coins is a list where each element represents an amount of money that you can make with that coin and amount is the amount of money you are trying to make with that coin. You can only make each coin amount times worth of coins. You can flip a coin with probability 0.5. Since you have all the coin flips, you can just multiply all the flips to"}

I really appreciate it! The only thing is that the code didn't work when I tested with my test case (I added it at the very end of the question). The code should return 1 if the athlete has the highest score (or the one with the lowest score) and 0 if the athlete is the same. For example: findAthleteRank([-6, -1, 1, 2]) should return 1 because -6 is the highest score and 1 is the one who has the lowest score. findAthleteRank([-6, -1, -2, 1]) should return 0 because -6 is the highest score and -2 is the one who has the lowest score.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=python |>\nFirst of all, your function findAthleteRank is returning a value that is a function of score which is never used. Secondly, your function findAthleteRank is returning only the index of the athlete with the highest score. \nTo solve the problem of finding the index of the athlete with the highest score, you can use the following algorithm:\n<code>\ndef findAthleteRank(score):\n    scores = sorted(score)\n    return scores.index(max(scores))\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks "}

I'm using the same data as your example, and adding an extra item to the first list to show that it works in general. \n<code>\ndef deleteAndEarn(self, nums):\n    # base case\n    if nums == []:\n        return 0\n    # check if we can earn\n    elif nums[0] == 0:\n        return 1\n    # check if we can delete\n    else:\n        # base case\n        if nums[-1] == 0:\n            return len(nums)\n        # else use dynamic programming to find our best solution \n        else:\n            best = 0\n            # loop through all combinations of deleting and earning\n            for d in xrange(len(nums) - 1):\n                # loop through all numbers in our combination\n                for e in xrange(nums[d] + 1, nums[-1] + 1):\n                    # if our best so far is better than this combination \n                    if best > e:\n                        # update best solution\n                        best = e\n                        # update our current combination\n                        self.deleteAndEarn([nums[d], e])\n            return ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def deleteAndEarn(self, nums):\n        \n        dp = [0] * (max(nums) + 1)\n        \n        for num in  nums:\n            i = num - 1\n            j = num + 1\n            \n            if num > 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n                dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n            \n            elif num < 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n                dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n            \n            elif num == 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n                dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n        \n        return dp[nums]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt has one bug, when nums = [2, 3] and num = 1. the result should be 2, but your code returns 3\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have fixed it now.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\n<code>\ndef deleteAndEarn(self, nums):\n    \n    dp = [0] * (max(nums) + 1)\n    \n    for num in  nums:\n        i = num - 1\n        j = num + 1\n        \n        if num > 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n        \n        elif num < 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n        \n        elif num == 0 and dp[i] < dp[j]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i] + num\n        \n    return dp[nums]\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=0 tags=python,python-3.x |>\n<| c |>\nWelcome to Stack Overflow!

One way to do it is to create a global variable, and put it in the function definition:\n<code>\ndef findMaxForm(strs, m, n):\n    global max_path\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for s in strs:\n        max_path = []\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if i == 0:\n                dp[m - 1][i] = s\n            else:\n                dp[m - 1][i] = max(dp[m - i - 1][i - 1], dp[m - i - 1][i])\n                \n    for i in range(m + 1, n + 1):\n        dp[0][i] = 0\n        \n    return dp[0][0]\n</code>\nBut using global variables is not recommended and should be avoided if at all possible. Instead, you can rewrite your function to take in the maximum path so far"}

Good luck on your coding journey.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=algorithm,recursion,dynamic-programming,python |>\nFirst of all I think your approach is correct, but there are some issues with your code.\nFor example when you call\n<code>\nstoneGame([1,3,5,7,9])\n</code>\nthe recursion will go deeper and deeper until you run out of stack space, so your algorithm will not work as expected for many inputs. I would suggest to use memoization or dynamic programming techniques to solve this problem.

Your code is almost right, but you have to put `return shortestBridge(grid)` in the `dfs` function, not outside.

It helped me understand how it works. However, I still have a few questions: First, my understanding of how dynamic programming works is that you are creating a list of all the possible combinations of \"cur\", then you iterate over each item in the list and multiply it by the price of the item at the current index. Then, you add that to the dictionary. My question is, do we not need to iterate over the list to create the dictionary? Second, I ran your solution on the test case given in the original question and it worked fine, but when I tried to run it on my own test case, I got this error: \"RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\". I don't understand why this is happening, and I have no idea how to fix it.

Yes, I do understand your solution and understand that it works and I implemented it myself, but I was curious about how to solve the problem using dynamic programming (DP). I have already done it in O(n^3), but I was curious to see if I could solve it using DP. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nSo I did some work on DP and found a way to solve this problem in O(N^2) time. Basically, for each line I store the max sum that can be achieved if that line is crossed from any other line. Then, I find the max sum that can be achieved by crossing each line with a different line. I store the max sum in an array called maxSums. I repeat this process for each line and I keep track of the max sum. \n<code>\ndef maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2):\n    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n    maxSums = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(0, m):\n        maxSums[i] = max(maxSums[i-1], nums1[i] + nums2[i])\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        maxSums[i] = max(maxSums[i-1], maxSums[i-2", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2):\n    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n    for j in range(1, m + 1):\n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j - nums1[i-1]] + nums2[i-1] + nums1[i-1])\n    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`def maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2):\n    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n    for j in range(1, m + 1):\n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j - nums1[i-1]] + nums2[i-1] + nums1[i-1])\n    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease provide the complete code in the question itself by editing it.

Also note that the line `return [pair for pair in pairs if check_pair(pair[0], pair[1])]` only returns the first pair and that is why you got only one pair in the output.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=list,python,python-3.x,palindro", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def palindromePairs(words):\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    def check_pair(word1, word2):\n        if is_palindrome(word1 + word2):\n            return True\n        i1, i2 = 0, 0\n        while i1 < len(word1) or i2 < len(word2):\n            if i1 == len(word1) and i2 == len(word2):\n                break\n            if i1 < len(word1) or i2 < len(word2):\n                if i1 == len(word1) and i2 >= len(word2):\n                    return False\n                elif i1 >= len(word1) and i2 == len(word2):\n                    return False\n                if i1 < len(word1) or i2 >= len(word2):\n                    if word1[i1] != word2[i2]:\n                        return False\n                    i1 += 1\n                    i2 += 1\n                else:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    result = []\n    for word1 in words:\n        for word2 in words:\n            if word1 != word2 and check_pair(word1, word2):\n                result.append([word1, word2])\n    return result\n\nprint(palindromePairs([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"racecar\"]))\n\"\"\"\n</cell>\n<text>\nYour solution is here\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n\"\"\"\nSolution to part B\n\"\"\"\ndef palindromePairs(words):\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    def check_pair(word1, word2):\n        if is_palindrome(word1 + word2):\n            return True\n        i1, i2 = 0, 0\n        while i1 < len(word1) or i2 < len(word2):\n            if i1 == len(word1) and i2 == len(word2):\n                break\n            if i1 < len(word1) or i2 < len(word2):\n                if i1 == len(word1) and i2 "}

For example:\n<code>\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n</code>\nNow, for each list, you want to calculate the minimum score by adding k to each element and taking the minimum of the results. For example:\n<code>\n[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] = [6, 7]\n</code>\nTo get this result, you need to sort the lists by adding k to each element:\n<code>\n[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] = [4, 5]\n</code>\nOnce you do this, you can simply find the minimum element of each list and subtract k to it.

I had been trying to use the annotation for my first function but did not know enough about it yet. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=unit-testing,python,pytest dscore=2 |>\nMy suggestions:\n\nDon't use annotations for your functions.  They are for test framework purposes.  \nTest the function properly.  Don't try to test every possible input to your function and check if it works as intended.  Instead, use your function in ways that give it the expected input, get it working and check that the output is as expected.  \nDon't call your function twice in your tests.  That is a waste.  Instead have a single test that checks the output after applying your function.  See what happens if you call the function twice in a row (make sure you get the expected result after the first call).  If you get different results, that means you made a mistake somewhere.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a tags=unit-testing,python,pytest |>\nThere are several things you could do to improve your tests:\n\nDon't call your function twice in one test, instead test it twice. \nDon't use annotations. Pytest is using them for the purpose of test framework usage, which is completely unnecessary for unit testing.\nThe use of assert is not necessary since you are not using an assertion framework (you just want to assert that the function has returned the ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def num_valid_names(ideas):\n    count = 0\n\n    for ideaA in ideas:\n        for ideaB in ideas:\n            if ideaA != ideaB:\n           if ideaA.name == ideaB.name and ideaA.name.find(ideaB.name) != -1:\n               count += 1\n\n    return count\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI ran the code and got the same result as yours.

Can you explain the solution? I understand how the algorithm works but I don't understand why it's so intuitive.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe main point is that you have to remember all previous results, so the recursive calls are all done in reverse. One way you can think of it is that each recursive call adds one to the current row and column, but that means the maximum number you can get is 9. Now imagine a row and column that only go up to 6. How many times can you add one to both of those? By looking at the recursive calls, you see that the last recursive call will add one to the column and one to the row. So the maximum number you can get is 9-6 = 4. That's the maximum you can get by adding one to each row and column by looking at the recursive calls.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=dynamic-programming,algorithm |>\nMy solution to this problem is to implement the below algorithm (as per the question).

You also have an unnecessary loop over nums and a second loop that doesn't make much sense because you don't even use the inner loop.\nThe first thing you do is sort nums, which is unnecessary; the second thing you do is find the largest element of nums.

To fix this, you should probably use a collections.defaultdict(int) instead:\n<code>\ndef majorityElement(nums):\n    count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for num in nums:\n        count[num] += 1\n    num = max(count, key = count.get", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in dict:\n            dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            dict[num] = 1\n    count = []\n    for num in dict.keys():\n        if dict[num] == max(dict.values()):\n            count.append(num)\n    return count\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe above code is giving correct output for given test cases but not giving correct output for other test cases.

Since you are checking for the maximum of the dictionary values, so you will always get an empty list since there is no key. \nTo solve this problem, you need to check if the number of keys in the dictionary is greater than zero. \n<code>\ndef majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in dict:\n            dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            dict[num] = 1\n    sorted_dict = sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])\n    return sorted_dict[0][0]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\ni know i can use if else but i want to use only a ternary operator\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nwhat do you mean by `a ternary operator`? `ternary operator` mean `if else condition` and not `ternary operator`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\ni think you mean `ternary operator` not `ternary operator`\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=list,python |>\nYou can simply use if/else instead of ternary operator:\n<code>\ndef majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in dict:\n            dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            dict[num] = 1\n    sorted_dict = sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])\n    return sorted_dict[0][0]\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| a tags=list,python dscore=1 |>\nYou can use the following approach using ternary operator:\n<code>\ndef majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in dict:\n            dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            dict[num] = 1\n    sorted_dict = sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])\n    return sorted_dict[0][0] if sorted_dict else 0\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nthank you ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def majorityElement(nums):\n    dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in dict:\n            dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            dict[num] = 1\n    count_list = list(dict.values())\n    return max(count_list), count_list.index(max(count_list))\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI updated my answer.

You can do this by doing this:\n<code>\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef escapeGhosts(ghosts, target):\n    d_ghosts = defaultdict(list)\n    for ghost in ghosts:\n        d_ghosts[ghost[0]].append(ghost[1])\n        d_ghosts[ghost[1]].append(ghost[0])\n    return min(d_ghosts[target], key=lambda x: abs(x-target))\n", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef escapeGhosts(ghosts, target):\nghosts.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x[0]-target))\nfor ghost in ghosts:\n    ghost[0] = -abs(ghost[0])\n    ghost[1] *= -1\n    ghost[2] = -abs(ghost[2])\n    ghost[3] = -abs(ghost[3])\nreturn ghosts\n</code>\n```\n<|/ a tags=python,python-3.x dscore=0 |>\n<| a |>\n<code>\n def escapeGhosts(ghosts, target):\n        ghosts.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x[0]-target))\n        for ghost in ghosts:\n            ghost[0] = -abs(ghost[0])\n            ghost[1] *= -1\n            ghost[2] = -abs(ghost[2])\n            ghost[3] = -abs(ghost[3])\n        return ghosts\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=python,python-3.x dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nWelcome to Stack Overflow!

Also added the code for the main function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nThe way you have structured your code, your while loop will never terminate. This is because you are removing stones from stones in the while loop. If there are 3 stones, you remove 2 stones from the list in the while loop and then remove 1 stone from the list in the while loop and then remove 1 stone from the list in the while loop. There is nothing left to remove from the list, so the while loop will never terminate.\n<code>\ndef lastStoneWeight(stones):\n    while len(stones) > 1:\n        stones.remove(stones.pop())\n        print(len(stones))\n</code>\nWhat you are actually trying to do, is remove the last stone from the list after you remove all the stones below it. So the solution would be to rewrite your while loop like this:\n<code>\ndef lastStoneWeight(stones):\n    while len(stones) > 1:\n        stones.remove(stones[-1])\n        print(len(stones))\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=python |>\n<| c |>\nI realize I didn't explain well enough.

Your algorithm should take O(log N) time and O(N) space.\n\nFor example, given [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], you should return False as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] cannot be arranged into groups of 3 because they "}

So what is the problem?

It doesn't find where the first and second occurrence occur.  Your code finds the indexes of the first and second occurrence.

You only need to loop through every row and column once, since you already know what all the valid paths are in the grid. Just loop through every row and column once, keeping track of the largest plus sign in each position. Once you've done that, you can determine the largest plus sign by finding the largest plus sign at each row and column and then taking the max of the two.\n<code>\ndef largestPlusSign(n, mines):\n    grid = [[1] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for x, y in mines:\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        \n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n"}

Yes, the problem was that I did not add an if statement to check if there is only one element in the list, otherwise the program would have crashed. Thanks for pointing out the mistake! I'll edit my answer to include the solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,algorithm |>\nSince you mentioned that you are a beginner at programming, I recommend you to learn how to debug the code.\nThere are many ways to debug the code. The easiest one is to just print the values of the variables at each step in the code, like so:\n<code>\nfor i in range(2, len(nums)):\n    if((nums[i] - nums[i - 1]) % 2 == 0):\n        count += 1\n</code>\nThe next step is to print those values every time the code iterates, which is done by adding print() statements like so:\n<code>\nfor i in range(2, len(nums)):\n    if((nums[i] - nums[i - 1]) % 2 == 0):\n        count += 1\n        print('i: {}, nums[i - 1]: {}, nums[i]: {}'.format(i, nums[i - 1], nums[i]))\n</code>\nThis way, you can see exactly where the code doesn't work and why.\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| a tags=python,algorithm |>\nThe problem is most likely with your if statement.

There may be a better solution. Just think of that you need to find the count of arithmetic subarrays given as input list. The count of subarrays is independent of their lengths.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nMy apologies, I see now that you provided the code you are working with. I see a couple of issues with your code. First, you are missing an else statement in your for loop. Second, you are missing an if statement to increment the length variable if the length is greater than 1. Third, you are not incrementing the length variable if the length does not equal 0. Fourth, you are using an if statement to increment the count if the length is greater than 1, but you are missing an else statement to increment the count if the length is not greater than 1. Also, you are not updating the length variable in the else statement. I am working on an edit to my answer right now.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python |>\nYour code has a few issues.

In this problem, the value $s$ is given in a set $A$. One way to solve this problem is to write down the number of subsets $n$ that sum up to $s$. Then, we can see how many subsets of $n$ sum to $s$. Let's see an example. Suppose we have three elements in $A$ $A = {1,2,3}$. Then, we will find $3$ subsets that sum to $s$ as follows:\n\n${1,2,3},{1}$\n${1,2,3},{2}$\n${1,2,3},{3}$\n\nThese subsets sum to $3$. Then, we will find that $3$ subsets sum to $s$.

When we visit a node again we restore the previous color and unmark its neighbours.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=graph,bipartite,python,colors dscore=1 |>\nOne simple solution is to use DFS. \n\n<code>\ndef isBipartite(graph):\n    colors = [0] * len(graph)\n    def dfs(node, color):\n        colors[node] = color\n        for neighboors in graph[node]:\n            if not neighboors in colors:\n                dfs(neighboors, colors[node])\n        return colors[node]\n\n    colors = [0] * len(graph)\n    dfs(0, 0)\n    return colors[0] == 1 and colors[1] == 0\n</code>\n\nHope this helps.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nIt should be `colors[node] = color` "}

We then recursively solve the subproblems in order to find the best solution.\n<code>\ndef canWin(nums, turn):\n    \n    answer = []\n\n    # base case\n    if turn == 0:\n        return True\n\n    # recursive case\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        \n        # base case\n        if nums[i] == turn:\n            answer.append(True)\n", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef canWin(nums):\n    \n    def dfs(l, r, turn):\n        if l == r:\n            return nums[l] * tucked(turn)\n        if turn == 0:\n            if nums[l] == 0:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l+1, r, 0)\n        if turn == 1:\n            if nums[r] == 0:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l+1, r, 0)\n    \n    return dfs(0, len(nums)-1, 0)\n\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]))\nprint(canWin([0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1]))\nprint(canWin", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef canWin(nums):\n    \n    def dfs(l, r, turn):\n        if l == r:\n            return nums[l] * tuckles[turn]\n        else:\n            if turn == turns[-1]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return max(dfs(l, r-1, turn), dfs(l, r+1, turn)) + nums[l] * tuckles[turn]\n\n    return max(dfs(0, len(nums)-1, 0), dfs(0, len(nums)+1, 0))\n        \n        \n    \n</cell>\n<text>\nThe winning team is now set to 'L' and the loosing team is 'O'\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef winningPlay(nums, tuckles):\n    \n    def dfs(l, r, turn):\n        if l == r:\n            return nums[l] * tuckles[turn]\n        else:\n            if turn == turns[-1]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return max(dfs(l, r-1, turn), dfs(l, r+1, turn)) + nums[l] * tuckles[turn]\n\n    return max(dfs(0, len(nums)-1, 0), dfs(0, len(nums)+1, 0))\n\n</cell>\n<text>\nWe test our function by calling the function with the test case:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ncanWin([1,7,4,9,5,2,8,3])\n</cell>\n<cell>\ncanWin([1,7,4,9,5,2,8,3,4])\n</cell>\n<cell>\ncanWin([1,2,3,4,5,6])\n</cell>\n<cell>\ncanWin([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])\n</cell>\n<text>\nPart 4\n", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef canWin(nums):\n    \n    def dfs(l, r, turn):\n        if l == r:\n            return nums[l] * tucks[turn]\n        \n        if turn == 0:\n            if nums[l] >= nums[r]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l, l + 1, 0)\n        \n        if turn == 1:\n            if nums[l] <= nums[r]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l + 1, r, 1)\n    \n    turn = 0\n    dfs(0, 0, 0)\n    \n    return turn\n```\n\"\"\"\n</cell>\n<cell>\ndef canWin(nums):\n    \n    def dfs(l, r, turn):\n        if l == r:\n            return nums[l] * tucks[turn]\n        \n        if turn == 0:\n            if nums[l] >= nums[r]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l, l + 1, 0)\n        \n        if turn == 1:\n            if nums[l] <= nums[r]:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return dfs(l + 1, r, 1)\n    \n    turn = 0\n    dfs(0, 0, 0)\n    \n    return turn\n\ndef competingGame(stones):\n    return 1 if canWin(stones) else -1\n\ndef competingGame(stones):\n    competing_games = []\n    \n    for i in range(len(stones)):\n        stone = stones[i]\n        competing_games.append(competingGame([x for x in stones if x != stone]))\n    \n    return sum(competing_games)\n\ndef competingGame(stones):\n    competing_games = []\n    \n    for i in range(len(stones)):\n        "}

I have added the code snippet in the question for you to review. I am able to run your program on my machine. I am just not able to figure out what I am doing wrong. I have tried my best to understand your code, but I still do not understand the difference between my code and the code you provided. Would you be able to point me in the right direction?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python |>\nIn your code, I see that the for loop does nothing because you only increment right after you read fruit_count[fruits[right]] the first time, which means right will always be one more than len(fruits), so right < len(fruits) will always be false. Also, since you initialize left = 0 and right = 0 in max_fruits, max_fruits will always return 0.\nHere's a modified version of your code, which works (although I recommend using a dict as in Joseph's answer):\n<code>\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    fruit_count = {}\n    max_count = 0\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    \n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[right] not in fruit_", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    fruit_count = {}\n    \n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[right] not in fruit_count:\n            fruit_count[fruits[righet]] = 1\n        else:\n            fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1\n            \n        if fruit_count[fruits[right]] > max_count:\n            right+=1\n        else:\n            left+=1\n            max_count = fruit_count[fruits[right]]\n            \n        if right == len(fruits):\n            break\n        \n        \n    return max_count, left, right\n\nprint(max_fruits([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\n<code>\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    fruit_count = {}\n\n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[right] not in fruit_count:\n            fruit_count[fruits[righet]] = 1\n        else:\n            fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1\n\n        if fruit_count[fruits[right]] > max_count:\n            right+=1\n        else:\n            left+=1\n            max_count = fruit_count[fruits[right]]\n\n        if right == len(fruits):\n            break\n\n    return max_count, left, right\nprint(max_fruits([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=python |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\n<code>\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    fruit_count = {}\n    \n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    fruit_count = {}\n    \n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[right] not in fruit_count:\n            fruit_count[fruits[righ]] = 1\n            right += 1\n        else:\n            fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1\n            right += 1\n            \n        while left < right:\n            if fruit_count[fruits[left]] < fruit_count[fruits[right]]:\n                fruit_count[fruits[left]] += 1\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1\n                right += 1\n                \n        if fruit_count[fruits[right]] > max_count:\n            max_count = fruit_count[fruits[right]]\n    return max_count\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nYou can try the code below\n<code>\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"mango\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"grapes\", \"watermelon\", \"peach\", \"cherries\", \"strawberry\", \"lime\", \"watermelon\", \"lemon\", \"watermelon\"]\nfruits2 = []\nfor i in fruits:\n    if i not in fruits2:\n        fruits2.append(i)\n\nmax_count = 0\nfor fruit in fruits2:\n    if fruits.count(fruit) > max_count:\n        max_count = fruits.count(fruit)\n\nprint(max_count)\n</code>\nThe output will be 9\n<|/ a tags=python,algorithm |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\n<code>\n#coding=utf-8\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"mango\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"grapes\", \"watermelon\", \"peach\", \"cherries\", \"strawb", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef max_fruits(fruits):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    fruit_count = {}\n    \n    while right < len(fruits):\n        if fruits[right] not in fruit_count:\n            fruit_count[fruits[righet]] = 1\n        else:\n            fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1\n        right += 1\n        if fruit_count[fruits[right]] > max_count:\n            max_count = fruit_count[fruits[right]]\n            left = 0\n        \n    return max_count\nprint(max_fruits(fruits))\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have tried this and i get this error \"IndexError: list index out of range\" please help\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI fixed a typo in the code.

Conclusion\nCongratulations! You have completed all parts of this assignment. Now it's your turn to go over your algorithms, identify problems, and see if you can improve them. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nThink about how you would change the is_palindrome function to be case-insensitive. \nThink about the data types of the parameters. For example, does the function need to be able to handle unicode strings, or could it handle strings as lists?\nWhat could you do to make your function more Pythonic? \nThink about what additional functionality you might want to add to your functions. \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on your journey into the realm", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def is_palindrome_possible(s):\n    def is_valid_palindrome(left, right):\n        while left < right:\n            if s[left] != s[right]:\n                return False\n            left +=  1\n            right -=  1\n        return True\n\n    if not s:\n        return True\n\n    length = len(s)\n    if length < 2:\n        return True\n\n    if length == 2:\n        return s==s[::-1]\n\n    if not is_valid_palindrome(0, length//2):\n        return False\n\n    return is_valid_palindrome(length//2, length-1)\n\nif is_palindrome_possible(\"aba\"):\n    print (\"Palindrome possible\")\nelse:\n    print (\"Palindrome Not Possible\")\n</cell>\n<cell>\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    left, right = 0, len(s)-1\n\n    while left < right:\n        if s[left] != s[right]:\n            return False\n        left +=1\n        right -=1\n\n    return True\n\nif is_palindrome(\"aba\"):\n    print (\"Palindrome possible\")\nelse:\n    print (\"Palindrome Not Possible\")\n</cell>\n<cell>\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    left, right = 0, len(s)-1\n\n    while left < right:\n        if s[left] != s[right]:\n            return False\n        left +=1\n        right -=1\n\n    return True\n\nif is_palindrome(\"aba\"):\n    print (\"Palindrome possible\")\nelse:\n    print (\"Palindrome Not Possible\")\n</cell>\n<cell>\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    left, right = 0, len(s)-1\n\n    while left < right:\n        if s[left] != s[right]:\n            return False\n        left "}

Because in python 3, there is no `Node` class. So instead of `class Node`, use just `class TreeNode:`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you so much for your help. But could you please explain why we need to  use \"return Node(max_value, left_tree, right_tree)\" in the code? I thought we only need to use \"return left_tree or right_tree\" to achieve the same result\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBecause `left_tree or right_tree` means `if left_tree: return left_tree else right_tree`. But in this case, the `left_tree` is `None`, so it means `return right_tree`, which is wrong. So we put the `Node` class inside the `constructMaximumBinaryTree` function, so that when it returns `left_tree` or `right_tree`, it means `Node(max_value, left_tree, right_tree", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums):\n    \n    if not nums:\n        return None\n    \n    max_val = max(nums)\n    max_index = nums.index(max_vlaue)\n    \n    left = [nums[:i] for i in xrange(len(nums)) if nums[i] < max_val]\n    right = [nums[i:] for i in xrange(len(nums)) if nums[i] > max_val]\n    \n    return constructMaximumBinaryTree(left) + constructMaximumBinaryTree(right) + [max_val]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added a method with two parameters `nums` and `val`.

I do have one more question, what does \"if not node\" mean in python and why should we not just write \"if node\"\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`if not node` is an idiom to check whether a node exists. A node can exist or it can not. `if node` would check if it exists, which is not what we want here. We want to check if it has a right subtree or left subtree, but there is no such subtree if there is no node. `if node` will throw an error if node is not defined, which might not be what you want. So we check whether it exists. If it does, then we can check whether it has a right subtree or left subtree, which we do by calling `checkHeight` with its left and right subtrees.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def isBalanced(root):\n        def checkHeight(node):\n                    if not node:\n                        return 0\n        leftHeight = checkHeight(nodul.leftChild)\n        rightHeight = checkHeight(nodul.rightChild)\n        if leftHeight > rightHeight:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your help.

You need to use your l variable from the previous function, which in turn needs a variable l.\n<code>\ndef numberOfBoomerangs(points):\n    def distance(p1, p2):\n        return (p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(l):\n        for j in range(l):\n            if i != j:\n                res = res + distance(points[i], points[j])\n    return res\n</code>\nIn addition, when you are defining the variable l, you also need to define it as a global variable. For example, add global l to the line before you define it. This will allow you to access the variable l from within another function.\n<code>\nglobal l\nl = 3\n</code>\nFinally, there are a few other issues with your code. Firstly, you seem to be confusing variable and function names, as you have a variable l defined and a function called numberOfBoomerangs. You also seem to be mixing up variables and parameters. To clarify, you have a function called numberOfBoomerangs and it takes one parameter, points, which is a list of lists. You also have a variable called l defined in the same function.

As far as your code is concerned, your algorithm checks whether an array is a mountain or not based on the first 3 elements. Then the algorithm adds up the next 3 elements and checks whether they add up to the last element in the array. I would simply use two nested for loops. Also, I don't understand the reason for using an `if else` statement when you already have `return` statements.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIn your code you used two `for loops`, with two `if else` statements inside them.

But, I don't know how to do that with 4 variables. Please help.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI cannot use string concatenation because I cannot tell how many variables are needed to be printed. So, I am looking for an algorithm to print as many as possible. So, if I say that a = 4 and b = 2 and c = 1, then it should print abc. But if a = 5 and b = 1 and c = 2, then it should print abbc. Does that make sense?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, Please see the updated code. I think this should work.

Also note that if you move the mass = 5 line to be right before the return statement in canDestroyAsteroids, then the function will always return false as you set mass to 4 on the next iteration (since you set mass = 5 in the loop).

Instead, you should use a recursive solution that uses O(1) space, as follows:\n<code>\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def longestUnivaluePath(self, root):\n    def dfs(node):\n        nonlocal res\n        if not node:\n            return 0\n        left_length = dfs(node.left)\n        rigth_length = dfs(node.right)\n        if not left_length or not rigth_length:\n            return max(left_length, rigth_length)\n        return max(left_length, rigth_length) + 1\n    dfs(root)\n    return res\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have edited my answer, please take a look at it and let me know if it works.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes it works, I appreciate your help thank you very much\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou are welcome. Please upvote my answer and accept it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe most simple solution would be to use recursion:\n<code>\ndef longestUnivaluePath(self, root):\n    if root is None:\n        return 0\n    left = self.longestUnivaluePath(root.left)\n    right = self.longestUnivaluePath(root.right)\n    return max(left, right)\n</code>\nBut I guess you want an iterative solution.\nOne possibility would be to store the paths and then find the longest one.\n<code>\ndef longestUnivaluePath(self, root):\n    if root is None:\n        return 0\n    paths = [[] for _ in range(2 ** len(root.path))]\n    paths[root.path[0]].append(root.path)\n    paths[root.path[-1]].append(root.path)\n    return max(paths, key=lambda path: len(path[0]))\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 tags=python,longest-path,tree,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nThanks but it doesn't work when I test it on this tree : [link](https://imgur.com/a/", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def longestUnivaluePath(self, root):\n    def dfs(node):\n        nonlocal res\n        if not node:\n            return 0\n        left_length = dfs(node.left)\n        rigth_length = dfs(node.right)\n        if left_length > rigth_length:\n            left_length += 1\n            res.add(node.val)\n        else:\n            rigth_length += 1\n            res.add(node.val)\n        return max(left_length, rigth_length)\n\n    if not root:\n        return 0\n    left_length = dfs(root.left)\n    rigth_length = dfs(root.right)\n    return max(left_length, rigth_length)\n\n\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot.right.right = TreeNode(7)\nroot.left.left.left = TreeNode(8)\nroot.left.left.right = TreeNode(9)\nroot.right.left.left = TreeNode(10)\nroot.right.left.right = TreeNode(11)\nroot.right.right.left = TreeNode(12)\nroot.right.right.right = TreeNode(13)\nprint(longestUnivaluePath(root))\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef longestUnivaluePath(root):\n    def dfs(node, path):\n        if not node:\n            return 0\n        left_length = dfs(node.left, path + [node.val])\n        rigth_length = dfs(node.right, path + [node.val])\n        return max(left_length, rigth_length)\n\n    if not root:\n        return 0\n    left_length = dfs(root.left, [])\n    rigth_length = dfs(root.right, [])\n    return max(left_length, rigth_length)\n\n\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\n"}

I've made a few changes to your code to make it easier to understand. Firstly, I've added a base case to stop recursive calls when there are no more possible moves. Secondly, I've used enumerate to generate the list of moves rather than using range. Thirdly, I've used the return value rather than printing it so you can see the results. I've also used a dictionary for caching results to avoid having to check them multiple times. Lastly, I've made some changes to your function so that you can use a list instead of a tuple for paths. \n<code>\ndef generate_coordinates(s):\n    paths = []\n    visited = set()\n    \n    def backtrack(index, path):\n        if index == len(s):\n            paths.append(path)\n            return path\n        \n        for move in s:\n            visited.add(index)\n            path = list(path)\n            path.append(move)\n            \n            if move not in visited:\n                backtrack(index + 1, path)\n                \n    backtrack(0, [])\n    return paths\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>"}

This happens in many programming languages. For example, in Python a recursive function is defined as follows\n<code>\ndef some_function():\n    if some_condition():\n        return some_result()\n    return some_other_result()\n</code>\nAn iterative function can look like this\n<code>\ndef some_function():\n    some_result = some_condition()\n    while some_result:\n        some_result = some_other_result()\n</code>\nIn this case some_function will either terminate or run indefinitely. \nThe while loop will run until some_result is False (or until you explicitly break out of it).\nThe two concepts are very different. Recursion is used when you want to solve an algorithm by calling the same algorithm again and again until a stop condition is reached. Iteration is when you want to loop through a set of items and perform some action on them in sequence. \nRecursion is used when you have a function that calls itself again and again until a certain condition happens. An example of such a function is factorial. \n<code>\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return ", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:```python\ndef largestIsland(grid):\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid) and grid[r][c] == 1:\n            grid[r][c] = 0\n            return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)\n        return 0\n    max_size = 0\n    island_sizes = {}\n    for i in range(len(grid) - 1):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 1):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                max_size = max(max_size, dfs(i, j))\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                island_sizes[(grid[i][j], i, j)] = dfs(i, j)\n    return max(max_size, island_sizes[(max_size, 0, 0)])\n```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt seems like you misunderstood my question.

Your code worked perfectly well on my system on Python 3.5.1. I did notice that when I ran the code from my computer I got different output than when I ran it on repl.it. I ran the code on repl.it using Python3.5.2 and got the following error `TypeError: unorderable types: str() <==> str()`. I found the error by searching stackoverflow for the error and found this link (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4770297/why-am-i-getting-a-typeerror-when-trying-to-order-a-list) which helped me solve the problem and now the code works on repl.it too.

Please find the edited code in the question above.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nSo the problem here is that you are using one for loop to iterate over the strings. But you are using two for loops. One inside the other one inside the same for loop. That's not going to work because as soon as you enter the first for loop, you will iterate over all the strings in the second for loop. So the solution would be to separate each string into two strings to iterate over.\nHere's an example of how you might do that:\n<code>\ndef numSimilarGroups(strs):\n    count=0\n    for str1 in strs:\n        firstWord = str1.split()[0]\n        for str2 in strs:\n            secondWord = str2.split()[0]\n            count += levenshteinDistance(firstWord, secondWord)\n    return count\n\ndef levenshteinDistance(firstWord, secondWord):\n    distance=0\n    distance=firstWord.count(' ')+secondWord.count(' ')\n    for x in range(len(firstWord)):\n        if firstWord[x]!=secondWord[x]:\n            distance+=1\n    return distance\n</code>\nI hope this helps.\n<|/ a tags="}

The annotation def countArrangement(n): will make python think that the countArrangement function returns a function and not the actual value. The function backtrack will then be called with the input parameter 0 and the list [n]. The return value of backtrack is then returned from countArrangement, which means that this function will return the actual value of this function. \n<code>\ndef countArrangement(n):\n    def backtrack(index, nums):\n        if index == len(nums):\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            nums[", "Variant5_full_gen_index_3": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def countArrangement(n):\n    def backtrack(index, nums):\n        if index == len(nums):\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            nums[inde] = nums[i]\n            count += backtrack(index + 1, nums)\n            nums.pop(inde)\n        return count\n    return backtrack(0, [0]*n)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease read [How do I ask and answer homework questions?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/334822/how-do-i-ask-and-answer-homework-questions)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,arrays,python |>\nAs you mentioned above that you are not allowed to use any data structure, this is just a solution based on stack:\n<code>\ndef countArrangement(n):\n    stack = [0]\n    count = [0] * (n+1)\n    for x in range(1, n+1):\n        stack.append(x)\n        count = 0\n        while stack[-1] != x:\n            count += count[stack.pop()] + 1\n        count[x] = count[x]-1\n    return count\n\nprint(countArrangement(7))\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks a lot!

Otherwise, we only need to search the left and right part of the middle row/column to find the middle element. For example, if the target value is 6 and we have 4 rows and 3 columns, we only need to search the middle row/column and compare it to the target value. If the target value is 3, only left and right row/column can be searched. In that case, we only need to search the left and right parts of the middle row/column to find the middle element.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt seems the OP is trying to find all possible combinations of `matrix[i][j]` such that `"}

It is not the complete solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,image-processing |>\nThis is a very general question, so I guess any answer will require more knowledge of your specific images and your specific situation.  In particular, how do you define \"overlap\"?  Is the overlap a pixel count (perhaps including the number of neighboring pixels), or perhaps something else?  Can you assume that \"nearby\" means exactly the same, or can you tolerate slight differences in brightness between pixels?  Are the images similar (i.e. identical)?\nI think that what you are looking for is something called \"segmentation\".  Google will give you a number of hits.  What you are looking for is probably not trivial to do by hand; you need to take into account the various kinds of shapes and features in the images.  For instance, if the background is all solid colors, then you can probably use a segmentation algorithm to extract a flat segmentation of the image.  If the background is all grayscale, then a segmentation algorithm will probably be unable to do much but extract a flat segmentation.  A more complex algorithm will probably be able to extract a variety of shapes, but may also require some work on your part.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nAss", "Variant5_full_gen_index_1": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def minOverlap(segments):\n    segments.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    painting = []\n    left = segments[0][0]\n    right = segments[0][1]\n    mix = set([segments[0][2]])\n \n    for segment in segments[1:]:\n        if segment[0] > left:\n            painting.append(segment)\n            left = segment[0]\n            mix.add(segment[2])\n        else:\n            if segment[1] > right:\n                painting.append(segment)\n                right = segment[1]\n                mix.add(segment[2])\n            else:\n                if segment[0] == segment[1] and segment[2] not in mix:\n                    painting.append(segment)\n                    mix.add(segment[2])\n    painting.append([left, right, segments[-1][2]])\n    return painting\n<|/ a tags=python,python-3.x,list,overlap |>\n<| c |>\nI am getting error with your code\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have edited the question, please take a look at it\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have edited the question, please take a look at it\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=python,python-3.x,list,overlap |>\nI have written a function for you, here it is:\n<code>\ndef overlap(segments):\n    segments.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    left = segments[0][0]\n    right = segments[0][1]\n    mix = set()\n \n    for segment in segments[1:]:\n        if segment[0] > left:\n            mix.add(segment[2])\n            left = segment[0]\n        else:\n            if segment[1] > right:\n                mix.add(segment[2])\n                right = segment[1]\n            else:\n                if segment[0] == segment[1] and segment[2] not in mix:\n                    mix.add(", "Variant5_full_gen_index_2": "Please complete the code as given and don't give other test annotation:def minOverlap(segments):\n    segments.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    painting = []\n    left = segments[0][0]\n    right = segments[0][1]\n    mix = set([segments[0][2]])\n \n    for segment in segments[1:]:\n        if segment[0] < left:\n            left = segment[0]\n        if segment[1] > right:\n            right = segment[1]\n        mix.add(segment[2])\n    \n    #print left, right, mix, painting\n    while painting:\n        painting2 = []\n        painting.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        for segment in painting:\n            if segment[2] not in mix:\n                painting2.append(segment)\n        painting = painting2\n \n    return painting\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for helping me out.

I also added the test case for which the code is failing. Can you please take a look and let me know if anything is wrong?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNope, looks good to me.  One minor bug: you're not handling the case where no sticker can be chosen.  In that case, `dp[i][j]` will be `float('inf')`.  That happens because you wrote `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-stickers[i-1]] + 1)`.  That should be: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-stickers[i-1]] + 1, dp[i][j])`.  (Note also that this is really just a typo.)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,dynamic-programming,python |>\n<code>\ndef minStickers(stickers, target):\n    n = len(stickers)\n    m = len(target)\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + "}
